# Test Coverage Report - Permission-Based Tool Discovery

## Summary

After implementing the permission-based tool discovery system, we've updated and created tests to ensure proper coverage of the new functionality.

## New Tests Created

### 1. Permission Discovery Service Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/auth/permission-discovery.test.ts`
- ✅ Detects read-only access when only GET requests succeed
- ✅ Detects write access when POST requests succeed  
- ✅ Detects admin access when analytics endpoints succeed
- ✅ Handles validation errors gracefully
- ✅ Handles 404 errors for non-existent endpoints
- ✅ Cleans up test resources created during discovery
- ✅ Builds comprehensive capabilities object
- ✅ Includes delays to avoid rate limiting

### 2. Base Tool Permission Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/tools/base-permissions.test.ts`
- ✅ Tests `isAvailableForUser()` method with various permission scenarios
- ✅ Tests `getMissingPermissions()` to identify what permissions are lacking
- ✅ Tests `getRequiredAccessLevel()` returns correct access levels
- ✅ Tests `getRequiredPermissions()` returns all required permissions
- ✅ Verifies permission metadata is included in tool metadata

## Updated Tests

### 1. Server Unit Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/mcp/server.test.ts`
- ✅ Updated mock dependencies to include new required services
- ✅ Fixed test expectations for NODE_ENV=test mode
- ✅ Updated MCP request handler tests to use SDK schemas
- ✅ Fixed tool registration test with proper mock structure
- ✅ All 25 tests now passing

## Known Test Issues

### 1. E2E Tests
**Status:** ❌ Failing
**Issue:** Tests expect old protocol methods ('tools/list') but server uses MCP SDK schemas
**Fix Needed:** Update E2E tests to use proper MCP protocol

### 2. Some Tool Tests
**Status:** ❌ Minor failures
**Issues:**
- `UpdateFeatureTool` - error handling expectations
- `ListNotesTool` - response format expectations
**Fix Needed:** Update test expectations to match new response formats

## Test Coverage Gaps

### 1. Resources and Prompts
No tests exist yet for the new MCP capabilities:
- Resource registration and retrieval
- Prompt registration and execution
- Integration with server

### 2. Permission-Based Tool Filtering
While the mechanism is tested, we should add integration tests for:
- Different token permission levels seeing different tool sets
- Permission upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- Edge cases with partial permissions

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority:**
   - Fix E2E tests to use proper MCP protocol
   - Add integration tests for resources and prompts

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Fix remaining tool test failures
   - Add more comprehensive permission scenario tests

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Add performance tests for permission discovery
   - Add tests for permission caching (if implemented)

## Test Execution Summary

```bash
# All new permission tests pass
npm test -- tests/unit/auth/permission-discovery.test.ts  # ✅ 8 passed
npm test -- tests/unit/tools/base-permissions.test.ts     # ✅ 10 passed

# Server tests fixed and passing
npm test -- tests/unit/mcp/server.test.ts                 # ✅ 25 passed

# Overall test status
# Failed: E2E tests (timeout issues)
# Failed: 2-3 tool tests (minor expectation mismatches)
# Passed: All core functionality tests
```

The permission-based tool discovery system is well-tested at the unit level, with comprehensive coverage of the core functionality.
